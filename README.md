# Diversity-in-GSIMR
Diversity analysis is a branch of HR Analytics, which is used to analyze the  diversity (Employees from different backgrounds such as: caste, religion, gender,  age-group etc.) present in an organization. I have applied Diversity analysis on the  dataset of students of my college GSIMR (Govindram seksaria Institute of Management  and Research).
